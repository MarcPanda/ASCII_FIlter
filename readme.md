# ASCII art OBS shader

To use this shader in OBS, use the plugin `Shader Plugins` at https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/shader-plugins.768/

# How to use

First, you need to generate a FNT and PNG file using the software bmfont and a font you want to use (itâ€™s better to choose a monospace font).
The PNG image is referenced by the OBS plugin into the `uniform texture2d fontTexture`.
The FNT file is sent into the glyphSort program (provided in this project), that generate the two variables `static int nbChars` and `static struct Char chars[]`.
You must past these variables into the shader file (if these variables are already in the file, remove them first).

Finally, load the shader into OBS. Select your source, add the USer-defined shader and select the shader file. Finally, set the fontTexture configuration to the PNG image generated by bmfont.
